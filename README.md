Hi, My name is Michael De Lagrave Viau but my friends and family call me MIKA.

I am 28 years old, originally from Montreal, Canada and I am currently located in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico.

I have been living in the Mexican Caribbean for the last 10 years, If I could see your face now, I am sure you are asking; Why Mexico? I found in Mexico something I haven't found nowhere else; A peaceful place with amazing people, a relax living style and a place that allow me to be in the water. I love diving or any water sports and Playa del carmen is the paradise for that. Without forgetting the warm Caribbean weather. Trust me, I don't miss the snow lol

I always love being in Playa del carmen, since the day I arrived and have worked in tourism as a tour guide and as a local expert. Then covid arrived and everything changed. After months of living in a tourism destination without any tourist I realized that it was time for me to start focusing on a real professional career. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do or become but I wanted something that I like, allows me to work remotely to keep travelling and something that can give me the opportunity to leave a mark, to change the world.

This is why in 2021 I sign up for a Software Engineering Bootcamp. I love technology and this course provide me knowledge that will give me the opportunity of a work that will provide me daily challenges, I will be able to create and leave a mark and I will be able to work anywhere remotely

This my first professional portfolio to show the work I am doing with the boot camps and every week I will be updating the page with the homework and side projects I will be working on in order to gain experience and show the world my work!
